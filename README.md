The influence of the movie Shark Tale on shark attacks

Intro:
Sharks always had a fierce and intimidating reputation until the movie Shark Tale came out (01 Nov 2004), a movie that ridiculed sharks, specially White sharks, and made fun of them on the big screen. Did the (white) sharks feel like they had to prove themselves after this movie damaged their reputation? Hypothesis:

- Sharks in general attacked more people after the release of the movie to restore their reputation
- White sharks attacked more people after the release of the movie to restore their reputation
- Other species of sharks do not feel empathy for white sharks
- The movie influenced the way sharks attacked people

Method:
First we removed all data from that is not relevant for our hypothesis, we dropped columns and deleted rows that were (mostly) nan values, dropped duplicates and renamed a few columns.
Afer this we organised the data we needed, there were lots of columns referring to the same thing using different formats (such as date, activities and time). To resolve this and keep as much data as possible, we used regnex or made dictionaries.

After cleaning and organising the data, we compared the charts to confirm or reject the hypothesis.

Conclusion:
After this analysis we can conclude that White sharks felt offended by the way they were portraited in the movie Shark Tale. They had to do what they could do to get their fierce and killer reputation back; attack more people. About a year after the movie's release, it reached it's peak and they calmed down again. Other species of sharks did not feel empathy for the way white sharks image was damaged, and they continued doing their own thing. There is no clear indication that the movie had influence on the activities people were doing while they were attacked.
